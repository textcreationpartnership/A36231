         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Treatiſe concerning the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, according to the Laws of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>AS in mans body (for the preſervation of the whole) divers Functions and Offices of Members are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; even ſo in all well-governed Common-wealths a diſtinction of perſons is neceſſary. And the Policy of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> for the maintenance and government of the Common-wealth of the ſame, hath made a three-fold diviſion of perſons: That is to ſay;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The King, or Soveraign Monarch; under which names, alſo a Soveraign Queen is comprized, as declared by the Statute thereof made in the firſt yeer of Queen <hi>Mary, Anno</hi> 5 <hi>Parl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Nobility, which do comprehend the Prince, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons Spirituall and Temporall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Commons, by which generall words are underſtood Knights, Eſquires, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and Labourers: But my purpoſe at this time, being onely to ſpeak of the Nobility, and eſpecially ſo much of them as I finde written in the Books of the common Law, and Statutes of this Realm; This firſt I have obſerved, That our Law calleth none Noble, under the degree of a Baron, and not as men of forraign Countries do uſe to ſpeak, with whom every man of Gentle Birth is counted Noble; for we dayly ſee, that both Gentlemen and Knights
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58491:4"/>do ſerve in the Parliament, as Members of the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>vide Lamberts Juſtice of Peace, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do theſe words, the Nobles, the high or great men of the Realm, imply the Perſon and Majeſty of the King, <hi>Dier.</hi> 155. But with the Civilians, the King is reckoned among his Nobles, <hi>Doct. Ridley, fol.</hi> 93.</p>
            <p>The Nobility are known by the generall name of Peen of the Realm, or the Barony of <hi>England;</hi> for Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, and Earls, and all other of the Nobility do ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Kings great Councell in Parliament, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and in right onely of their Baronies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the generall names of Barons of this Realm, and for the Baronage thereof, we do underſtand the whole Body of the Nobility. The Parliament-Robes of Dukes differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing from the Barons, but they wear the Guards upon their ſhoulders three or four fold; for although Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, and Viſcounts in their Creations are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with Garments of Silk and Velvet, yet in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they uſe the ſame as Barons do, made with Scarlet, with divers differences of white Furre, ſet with Freinges or Edging on their ſhoulders: for there they ſit by reaſon of their Baronies, and according to their dignity take their places, <hi>Thomas Mills, fol.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p>And hence it was, that thoſe bloody Civill Warres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the liberties granted by the great Charter, both in the time of King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> 3, his ſonne, perſecuted by all the Nobility of this Realm (ſome few excepted) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our Hiſtory, The Barons Warres: Neither have the Spirituall Lords and Peers of the Parliament any other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to that preeminency, but becauſe of their ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies: For although originally all the poſſeſſions of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Abbots, and Pryors, were given and holden in <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almayn,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58491:4"/>yet ſhortly after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt; moſt of their Tenures were altered, <hi>viz. per Baroniam,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Matthew Parris, Anno</hi> 1070. 66, and of that Tenure have continued ever ſince, as you may reade by the Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Claringdon,</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. and in <hi>Glanvile</hi> and <hi>Bracton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Tenure of all Abbots and Pryors were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the uniting and conveying them to the Crown, by the Statute of diſſolution of Monaſteries, made <hi>Anno</hi> 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. And though the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> in Titles, and by certain Ceremonies may be diſtinguiſhed, yet a Baron is in equipage, as unto Nobility and priviledges incident to their dignities, with Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, <hi>Cooks</hi> 6. <hi>part</hi> 53. And it is in ordinary experience, That Dukes, and others of any high degree of Nobility, in caſes criminall, are tryed by Barons, together with many Earls and Viſcounts, as their Peers, and Peers of the Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nobilitas</hi> generally ſignifieth, and is derived of the word <hi>Noſco,</hi> to know, ſignifying in common phraſe of ſpeech, both with the Latines, and eke with us Engliſh-men, a generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood and Degree, and therefore one ſaid, <hi>vir nobilis idem eſt quod notus &amp; per omnia, &amp;c.</hi> A Noble man is he who is known, and the Heroicall vertues of his life, talkt of in every mans mouth. But eſpecially it is applyed and uſed to expreſſe the reward of vertue in honorable meaſure, <hi>&amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris claritatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is not to be omitted, That the Law doth prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite any Subject of this Realm to receive Titles of Honor or dignity of the gift or Donation of a Forraigne Prince, or King, or Emperour; for it is a thing greatly touching the Majeſty of the King and the State of his Kingdom <hi>Eſt jus Majeſtotis &amp; inter inſignia ſummae poteſtatis.</hi> It is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58491:5"/>the right of Majeſty, and amongſt the Enſignes of high power, <hi>vide Cook</hi> 7. <hi>part</hi> 25.6. And if that man ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll bring an action, and in the Writ is ſtiled by ſuch forraigne title and name of Honour, the defendant may plead, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of his Writ, That he is no Duke, Marqueſſe, Earl, or Baron; whereupon if the plaintiff or demandant take iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, this iſſue ſhall not be tryed by Jury, but by Records of the Parliament, wherein he faileth.</p>
            <p>And if an Engliſh man be made Earl of the Empire, or of any other forraign Nation created into Honour, and the King alſo do make him into any Title of Honour in <hi>England,</hi> he ſhall now be named in all his judiciall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, onely by ſuch name and title as he hath received from the King of this Realm, whoſe Subject he is: and if by the King of <hi>England</hi> he be not advanced to Title of Honour, then ſhall he bear the name of his Baptiſm onely, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, unleſſe he be a Knight, 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Cook</hi> 7. <hi>part</hi> 16. <hi>a.</hi>

               <p>And here (by the way) may be obſerved, that in ancient
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58491:11"/>time, and in the time of the Engliſh Saxon Kings, the uſe was as well in penning the Acts of Parliament, as of the Kings Letters Patents, when any lands, franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or hereditaments, did paſſe from the King of any eſtate of inheritance, as alſo in their creations of any Man unto honour and dignity, the concluſion was with the ſigne of the Croſſe in forme aforeſaid (that is) <hi>his Teſtibus &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, it is enacted by the authority aforeſaid, that no perſon or perſons, of what degree, eſtate or condition, whatſoever he or they be, (except only the Kings chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) ſhall at any time hereafter attempt or preſume to ſit, or have place at any ſide of the cloth of ſtate in the Parliament chamber, neither of the one hand of the Kings Highneſſe, or of the other, whether the Kings Majeſty be there perſonally preſent or not.</p>

               <p>Of the moſt noble and excellent Prince that now is, it is truly ſaid, that he is <hi>omni nomine numine magnus,</hi> by deſtiny, name, &amp; providence of God, the greateſt; before <hi>Cook</hi> to the Reader, before his 8. Book, the laſt leaf.</p>

               <p>And in token of ſubjection, the Prince doth not upon his Poſie of his Arms diſdain the old Saxon word (<hi>Ich dien,</hi> I ſerve) as <hi>Lambert</hi> doth mention in his Book of Perambulation of Rent. 364.</p>
               <p>And there is a caſe, that <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> chief Juſtice of <hi>Engl:</hi> in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 4. did commit the Prince, who would have taken a priſoner from the Bar in the Kings Bench, and the Prince did humbly obey, and did go at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; in which the King did greatly rejoyce that hee had ſuch a Judge who durſt miniſter juſtice upon his ſon, and alſo that hee had a ſon ſo gracious as to obey, <hi>Court de Banco Regis,</hi> 79. <hi>Crompton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A queſtion was moved to the Juſtices in the firſt yeer of <hi>H.</hi> 7. what order ſhould be in that preſent parliament, for the anulling and making void certain attainders, for ſo much as divers who were returned of that Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did ſtand attainted of treaſon; and all the Juſtices reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That ſo many of the Knights of the ſhires, or Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, or Burgeſſes as ſtood then attainted of treaſon, ſhould depart out of the Parliament houſe at the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the Act of Parliament for their attainders. But as ſoon as the Act of Parliament was reverſed and annuld, that they and every of them (that is to ſay) Lords and Commons ſhould come into their places, and then may proceed upon any thing there moved lawfully, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons; for it is not convenient that they who are attainted ſhould be in places of lawfull Judges.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> the fourth ſon of king <hi>Edward</hi> 3. did take to wife <hi>Blanch,</hi> who was daughter and heir to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who had iſſue, <hi>Henry</hi> afterwards king of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that the ſaid Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did come unto the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> by diſcent from the part of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58491:16"/>his mother, and being a ſubject he was to obſerve the Common Law of the Land in all things concerning his Dutchie. For if he would depart in Fee with any part thereof, hee muſt make livery and ſeizen, or if hee had made a Leaſe for life, reſerving rent with a reentery for default of payment, and the rent happen to be behind, the Duke might not enter unleſſe hee doe make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or if he had aliened any part thereof whileſt he was with age hee might defeat the purchaſer for that cauſe, and if hee would grant a reverſion of any eſtate for life or yeares in being, there muſt alſo be Attornment, or elſe the grant doth not take effect.</p>

               <p>And likewiſe the name of the Duchie, and all the Franchizes, Liberties, and Juriſdictions of the ſame, when they were in the hands of him who had the Crowne and Juriſdiction Royall, were gone by the Common Law, and extinct, for the greater doth diſtinguiſh the leſſe, and after thoſe times the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Dutchie of LANCASTER
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58491:17"/>would not paſſe from King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, but by his Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> without livery of ſeiſin, and without Attornment; and if he make a Leaſe for life being Duke, reſerving a rent with reentry, for default of payment, and after his aſſumption of the Crown the rent happen to be unpaid, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter without demand; for the King is not bound to do ſuch perſonall Ceremonies as the Subjects are by the Law compelled to do. Therfore to have the ſaid Dutchy to be ſtill a Dutchy, with the liberties to the ſame, as it was before; and to alter the order &amp; degree of the lands of the Dutchy from the Crown, the ſaid King <hi>H.</hi> 4. made a Charter by authority of Parliament, which is intituled <hi>Charta Regis Henrici quarti de ſeperatione ducatus Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria a corona authoritate Parliamenti anno Regni ſui pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi> The Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> from the Crowne by the authority of Parliament, in the firſt yeer of his raign of the ſaid King, as by the tenure thereof may appear.</p>
               <p>And ſo by authority of Parliament, the ſaid Dutchy, withall the Franchiſes and liberties, were disjoyned from the Crown, and from the Miniſters and Officers of the Crown, and from the receit of the revenues of the Crown, and from the order to paſſe by ſuch conveyance which the ſaid Law did require in the poſſeſſions of the Crown.</p>
               <p>But although the poſſeſſions of the Dutchy by force of the ſaid Statute ſtood, divided from the Crown, and ought to be demeaned and ordered, and paſſe as they ought before <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was King; yet there is no clauſe ſet down in the ſaid Charter,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58491:17"/>which doth make the perſon of the king, who hath the Dutchy in any other degree then it was before; but things concerning his perſon, ſhall in the ſame eſtate as they were before ſeperations: Inſomuch, as if the Law before the Charter, by the authority of Parliament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the perſon of the King alwayes of full age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regard unto his gifts, as well of the lands which he doth inherit in his naturall body, as in that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit in the right of his Crown, or politique body, it ſhall be ſo adjudged for the Dutchy land after the ſaid Statute; for the Statute doth go, and reach unto the eſtate, condition, and order of the lands of the Dutchy, but doth not extend to the perſon of the king, who hath the lands in points touching his perſon, neither doth it diminiſh or alter the preheminences which the Law doth give, or attribute to the perſon of the King. For if king <hi>Henry</hi> 4. after the ſaid Act, had made a Leaſe, or other grant of parcell of the Dutchy by the name of <hi>H.</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> onely, it had been void; for it ſhould have been made in the name of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. king of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus ſtood the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſevered from the Crown all the raign of <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 5. and <hi>H.</hi> 6. being politiquely made for the upholding of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> their true and ancient inheritance, howſoever the right heir unto the Crown might in future time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his right thereunto (as it happened in king <hi>Edward</hi> 4. his time:) But after king <hi>Edward</hi> 4. obtained his right unto the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and was in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, he in Parliament attainted <hi>H.</hi> 6. and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unity, and annexed the ſaid Dutchy again unto the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as by the Statute thereof made in

                  <p>IT ſeemeth that the dignity was more ancient, then the Name, for in the ancient <hi>Conſtitutions Feedall</hi> of the Land, there is no mention made of the name of Barons, howbeit, the learned Interpreters do underſtand, that dignity to be comprehended under thoſe which are there called <hi>Valuaſores Majores,</hi> and afterward called <hi>Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> for of the <hi>Valuaſores,</hi> there were three kindes <hi>Valuaſores, Majores, ſive Capitanii;</hi> which are thought to be the Barons, <hi>Valuaſores minores</hi> and <hi>valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini</hi> or <hi>valuaſores minimi.</hi> The like dignity within this Realm before the Conqueſt had thoſe, which of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Saxons</hi> were called <hi>Thanes,</hi> whereof read <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Preambulation of <hi>Kent. Fol.</hi> 366. And the Book of Dooms-day, remaining in the treaſury of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Nevertheleſſe, the name of the Baron was not much uſed within this Realm untill the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58491:30"/>and after that the word Baron ſeemeth to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented in this Realm in lieu and place of the word <hi>Thane</hi> among the Engliſh Saxons, for as they in generall and large ſignification, did ſome time uſe the ſame to the ſence and meaning, and to import a Free-man, borne of a free parentage, or ſuch like; ſo did the <hi>Normans</hi> uſe the word Baron, and therefore called their free Citizens of their beſt eſteemed Cities, and free Burgeſſes of their beſt eſteemed Towns and Borroughes by the name of Barons. And ſo the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> Barons of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in divers ancient Monuments, of whom alſo <hi>Bracton</hi> maketh mention, <hi>Fol.</hi> 272. <hi>a.</hi> Alſo there are divers Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein mention is made of ſuch like Barons, as the Barons of <hi>Warwick</hi> in the Record of <hi>Doomſday;</hi> and even to our time the free Burgeſſes of the five priviledged Ports are called Barons of the Cinque Ports. And for that alſo divers of the nobility of Barons, as well ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall as temporall, did in ancient time ſit in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer to determine the difficulties and doubts there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; The Judges of that Court have been from moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time called, and yet are Barons of the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Engliſh Saxons had two kindes of <hi>Thanes</hi> the like hath been obſerved; as touching Barons for the Kings and Monarchs of this Realm have had their immediate Barons being the Peers of the Realm; and in like manner, certain other of the Nobility, eſpecially Earls, which have had juriſdiction Palatine, and Earls Marchers, whoſe Countries have confined upon the coaſts of the enemy; have had under them for their better defence, a kinde of Barons. As namely under the County <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> were theſe Barons, the Barons of <hi>Halton, Mounthalt, Malebanck, Shipbrooks, Malpaſe, Maſſa, Rinderton, Stockport, &amp;c.</hi> The Earldom of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>

And to this purpoſe you may read a private ſtatute in the eleventh yeere of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth mentioned alſo in <hi>Cambden</hi> concerning the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Arundell: and alſo another ſtatute to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe made 27. <hi>H.</hi> 6. for the finall determination of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between <hi>William</hi> Earl of Arundell, and <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of Devonſhire, for place and preheminence in Parliament.</p>
               <p>I would wiſh that thoſe who deny that there were or are any Barons by tenure, ſhould conſider adviſedly the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Weſtminſter the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>cap.</hi> 41. where the Fees of the Eatle Marſhall and Lord Chamberlain are expreſſed, which are to be taken by them, upon the homage done of every Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron by tenure, whether the Baron holdeth by whole Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or by leſſe.</p>
               <p>But ere I proceed further, there ariſeth a queſtion here to be conſidered, the reſolution whereof may give great light, and in a manner determine the matter in hand. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion therefore is this.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>If a Baron by tenure alien and grant away the Honour, Caſtle, and Mannour holden by Barony, whether ſhall ſuch alience or grantee take upon him the ſtate title and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Baron or no? and what ſhall become of ſuch a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58491:33"/>dignity of Baronage after ſuch alienation or grant made?</p>
                  <p>They which do deny that there are any ſuch Baronies by tenure, do uſe theſe as their chief and principall motives and reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if there be any Baronies by tenure, then the alience or grantee of ſuch Honour, Caſtle, or Mannour ſo holden, muſt hold by the ſame tenure that his feoffor or grantor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore held; But that was by Barony; Therefore ſuch alience or grantee muſt hold by Barony: And if ſuch grant or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be made to perſons baſe, vulgar, or ignoble, they then ſhould by ſuch tenure be made noble, which were marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous abſurd and full of inconveniency; for, <hi>Non Dominus domo, ſed domus Domino honestatur,</hi> ſee <hi>Tho.

                  <p>Secondly, it is very evident and manifeſt that many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mannours which in old time were holden <hi>per Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and were the Head of Baronies, are now in the tenures of mean Gentlemen, and others, who neither doe or may challenge unto themſelves in any reſpect thereof any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, without the great and high diſpleaſure of the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, who is the fountain of all Nobility within his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome ancient Barons there are which have alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſold away thoſe Caſtles and Mannours, of the which they have and beare the name and dignity of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and yet themſelves doe ſtill retain and lawfully keep their eſtate, dignity, and degree of Baron, and have been and uſually are (ſuch alienation notwithſtanding) ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nevertheleſſe to the Parliament, and they do take and hold their ancient place according.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58491:33"/>of all others the moſt materiall and of moment uſed in this behalf, it ſhall be convenient for the more eaſie unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtate of this queſtion, to exhibite certain neceſſary and requiſite propoſitions; and upon them to draw true and infallible concluſions, and then to prove them by authority of Law, conſent and time, and manifold preſidents: which done, the anſwere will be eaſily made (as I conceive) to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the foreſaid objections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, if a Baron by tenure, which holdeth any Caſtle, Honour, or Mannour <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> do alien or give the ſame, either he doth it without any licence obtained from his Majeſty ſo to do, or elſe by ſome certain licence in that behalf obtained.</p>
                  <p>If he doe it without, licence, then the concluſion is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the lawes of this Realme, the Barony, Caſtle, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Mannour ſo aliened without licence or conſent is forfeited; and the ſame Honour, Caſtle, or Mannour ſo holden by Barony, and ſo aliened, is to be ſeiſed into the Kings hands for the ſaid forfeiture, and ſuch dignity and eſtate no longer to be borne and continue, but to be reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and extinguiſhed in the Crowne, from whence it was derived.

                  <p>The reaſon thereof is notable, if we call to remembrance that which was formerly alledged out of <hi>Bracton;</hi> That Baronies are the ſtrength of the Realme, and ſuffer no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; they ſuffer alſo no alienation, without the conſent or licence of the ſoveraign Monarch; for ſo ſhould the Realme be enfeebled, and baſe perſons enabled, without deſert of vertue or proweſſe.

                  <p>In 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. it was found by office that <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of Cheſter had leaſed unto one <hi>John Peſton</hi> for his life a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which was parcell of the Mannour of the ſaid Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke, without licence; and it was reſolved by the Judges, and other of the Kings Councell, that the ſame was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; but by mediation of the ſaid Councell the Biſhop ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelfe to the King, and made a fine; and ſeverall <hi>Scire facias</hi> iſſued out againſt them that had received the maine profits, to anſwer unto the King thereof.

                  <p>Moreover, concerning the ſecond objection, it is very true that many ancient Mannours, which were anciently holden by Barony, as the head or parcell of a Barony, are now in the hands of Gentlemen meane and un-noble by blood, who neither doe nor may claime any Nobility or honour thereby. But the reaſon that ſome former gifts made by the Kings Majeſties progenitours, the ſupreme So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes of this Realme, to ſuch as they honoured, in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and ſupport of their honour, and by honourable ſervices, ſhould thus come to the hands of mean perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nages, are twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for that ſuch Mannours have been aliened by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence unto ſuch perſons before ſpoken, whom ſuch poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alone cannot make noble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (and that was uſually ſuch Mannours as were holden by Barony) have upon divers encheaſons and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions come to the Crowne, by way of revertor, or eſchete, or forfeit, by meanes whereof the ancient tenures derived from the Crowne (by reaſon of thoſe lands ſo comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Crown) were extinct, and after the ſaid lands were given or conveyed to others, reſerving other ſervices than thoſe which at the firſt were due for the ſame; ſo that it was no marvaile to ſee that ſome Mannours anciently holden by Barony, or other honourable ſervice ſhould now bee holden in ſoccage, or by other triviall or meane tenure.</p>
                  <p>As to that which was thirdly objected, that ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Barons there are which have aliened and ſold away thoſe Caſtle and Mannours, of the which they have and doe beare the name and dignity; and yet nevertheleſſe themſelves doe ſtill retaine and keep lawfully their eſtate, dignity and degree of a Baron, and have been and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58491:42"/>to the Parliament, ſuch alienation notwithſtanding. To this I anſwer, That it is true, but it proveth nothing againſt the former reſolution: And therefore for better ſatisfaction of this obſervation, it is to be conſidered, that ſuch Barons either be originally Barons by writ, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by tenure. Barons by writ (in this reſpect now in hand) are of two kindes; For either in ſuch writ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they or their Anceſtors were at firſt ſummoned, they were named onely by their owne names; or elſe there was addition given them of the principall place of their aboad; which was done either for diſtinction ſake, to ſever them from ſome honourable perſon of the ſame ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name; or elſe to give them ſuch honourable title by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place, which place notwithſtanding was not holden by Barony: And therefore if ſuch a Baron doe alien away that place which anciently was his ſeat, he may nevertheleſſe retain his honourable title, in reſpect had of ſuch a place.</p>
                  <p>But if a Baron by tenure doe alien away the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Caſtle, or Mannour holden by Barony, unto a mean perſon, not capable of honour, and that by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent licence ſo to doe, and after the alienour which made ſuch alienation be called by writ to the Parliament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title, or as Baron of ſuch Honour, Caſtle, or Mannour ſo aliened, he is not any more a Baron by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in reſpect of that place, for that he hath aliened that away which he held by Barony; but thenceforth, after ſuch writ of ſummons, he is become a Baron by writ, and may retaine the name of Baron by title of the place, as Baron by writ, ſuch alienation notwithſtanding; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the writ directed at the pleaſure of the Prince, doth give unto him that addition of name and dignity.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58491:43"/>And thus much touching the reſolution of the ſaid que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and ſatisfaction of the ſaid objections, and of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by tenure.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>BARONS by writ, which is the ſecond kind of Barons mentioned in the former Diviſions of BARONS.</head>
               <p>A Baron by writ is he, unto whom a writ of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (in the name of the King) is directed, to come to the Parliament, appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed at a certaine time and place to be holden; and there, with his Highneſſe, the Prelates, Nobility, and Peeres, to treat and adviſe touching the waighty affairs of the Realme: The forme of which writ is much to the effect of the writ before mentioned in the title of Earle; which kind of writ is as well directed to the Barons by tenure, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by creation, Patent, or otherwiſe. But thoſe which are not Barons by tenure, nor by Patent, and have onely ſuch writs, are therefore called Barons by writ; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receipt of ſuch writ, and place taken accordingly in Parliament, ought to enjoy the name, dignity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Baron.</p>
               <p>Touching the antiquity of Barons by writ onely, and their firſt inſtitution, I finde little or no mention before the time of <hi>H.</hi> 3. And therefore I conceive that either
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58491:43"/>the firſt of all, or at leaſt that the firſt frequent uſe of ſuch Barons was had and deviſed 49. <hi>H.</hi> 3. in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and upon a lamentable occaſion. For in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the King and his Nobility, in thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome warres, ſeditions, and rebellions, which they moved againſt the ſaid King, there were many cruell battells fought, to the great effuſion of Engliſh blood: of which rebellions <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of Leiceſter was ring-leader, for the defence of liberties (as they pretended) granted by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Charter of the Forreſt, which are even to this day the principall grounds of the poſitive Lawes, and are the moſt ancient ſtatutes in uſe within this Realme, and for defence of other conſtitutions and ordinances then made at Oxford: And after divers fields fought by them at Northampton, Rocheſter, Lewis, and other places; laſt of all was the cataſtrophe of that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy finiſhed at Eveſham, where the ſaid Earle of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter was ſlain, the King had the victory, and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Barons had the overthrow; whereupon preſently enſued the Parliament holden at Wincheſter, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter at Weſtminſter, where ſuch of the Barons as were ſlaine in the field againſt the King, and ſuch others of them alſo as were taken captive, and were fled, were to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſinherited of their livings: wherefore for as much as the number of Barons who had continued faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto the King, was ſmall. (who were the Peeres up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe tryall then theſe things were to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) it was holden a neceſſary policy to ſupply the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the diminiſhed Barons, and to fill up their rooms in Parliament with other wiſe and fit men, of the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and livelihood, upon ſummons by writ: By reaſon whereof at thoſe Parliaments were called the Abbots
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58491:44"/>and Priors of the Realme, as well thoſe that held not by Barony, as others: and divers others of the moſt worthy of the Laity not holding by Barony: And theſe by means thereof were thenceforth Barons by writ. But certain of the ſaid Abbots and Priors, which held not by Barony, and thought it a burthen to their houſes, got themſelves upon petition afterward to be exempt, as by divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords thereof remaining in the Chancery may appeare.</p>
               <p>This moreover is to be noted concerning the writ of ſummons to the Parliament, that theſe writs in forme of their direction are diverſe. Some directed by ſpeciall name of Barons: as, <hi>Rex, &amp;c. Edmundo Baroni de Staffort; Johanni Baroni de Greystock: Johanni Baroni Dudley.</hi> Some others by the name of the party, with addition of the place; as, <hi>Johanni Stronning de Knocking Militi; Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundo Grey de Ruthin Militi; Edvardo Grey de Grooby Militi; Johanni le Scroop de Maſham Militi; Willihelmo Zouch de Harrington Militi;</hi> naming the chiefe Caſtle or Mannour of ſuch Baron, which alway ſtandeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the head place of the Barony: wherefore the ſaid Baron and his heires ſhall be ſirnamed and called, and ſhall continue that name of place, although he doe alien away the ſame, as before is ſaid. Some others are named in this manner, with the title of Lord; as, <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Beauchamp Domino Clinton, Henrico Piercy Domino de Poynings.</hi> To ſome others the ſaid writ is directed onely by their name, without any addition of place or dignity; as, <hi>Willihelmo de Lovell Militi, Tho de Scales Militi, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihelmo Devereux Militi.</hi> See <hi>Tho. Mills</hi> Nobility Politicall and Civill.</p>
               <p>But the nature, quality, and condition of theſe Barons by writ is aptly diſcovered by the debate of a queſtion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58491:44"/>moved among men, and ſpoken of concerning the deſcent and continuance of a Barony by writ: which queſtion for the more orderly diſpoſition thereof, I doe divide into theſe articles or points.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, whether a Barony by writ may deſcend from the Anceſtor to the heire, or not?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, admit ſuch a Barony may deſcend, then whether it do deſcend to the heire female or not, if there be heires male, though not ſo neare as the females.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, admit it doe deſcend to the heires females, then whether may the husband of ſuch heire female take upon him the name, ſtile, and dignity of ſuch Barony <hi>in jure uxoris,</hi> or not?</p>
                  <p>As touching the firſt queſtion, it ſhall be requiſite for the more ſatisfaction of all men to alledge ſuch principall reaſons as are wont to be produced on both parts.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore that maintaine the negative part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that ſuch Barony ſhould deſcend, do ſtrengthen themſelves with theſe or the like arguments, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nobility and honour, which are given in reſpect of wiſedome, counſell, and advice, being gifts of God to the perſon of a man, cannot extend to any other perſon, or deſcend from one man to another: for it is a rule of the law of reaſon, <hi>Quod privilegium perſonale perſonam ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; extinguitur ad perſonam:</hi> But ſuch is the dignity of a Baron by writ: Therefore it is reaſon that it ſhould not deſcend from the Anceſtor to the heire.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if the calling to Parliament by writ bee the efficient inſtrumentall cauſe of ſuch Nobility to the Anceſtor, the not calling of the heire is the loſſe of that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58491:45"/>Nobility; for if the heire have defects of nature in him, as Idiocy, Frenzy, Leproſie, and ſuch like, whereby he is unfit for counſell and converſation, by what reaſon ſhould he enjoy that dignity whereof he is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or uncapable: for the effect hath no place where the cauſe doth faile. And hereof they doe conclude that ſuch dignities of Baronies by writ ſhould not deſcend.</p>
                  <p>Of the contrary part the affirmative part is proved thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Honour which is given in reſpect of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vertue of him upon whom it was firſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not onely a due recompence for himſelfe while he liveth, but alſo a memorable reward thereof in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. The words of <hi>Cicero</hi> to this effect are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, <hi>Hominis boni ſemper Nobilitati favemus, &amp; quia utile eſt reip. eſſe &amp; homines dignos majoribus ſuis, &amp; quia valere debet apud nos claros hujuſmodi ſenes fuiſſe, ne reip. moriretur memoria etiam mortuor, honor.</hi> Therefore this kinde of honour is patrimoniall and hereditary, for things which are once granted to a man by the King for his honour, are not againe to be returned, either to his loſſe and diſcharge, or to his heires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the infamy of the Anceſtor be a blot to the Poſterity, as affirmeth the wiſe man, <hi>The children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of an ungodly father, becauſe they are reproved for his ſake:</hi> And for that alſo the Law of the Realme doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the bloud of the Poſterity by and upon the offenſe of Anceſtor, reaſon would alſo that the honour due to the Anceſtour ſhould be likewiſe honour to the poſterity: for contraries do carry alſo their contrary reaſons.</p>
                  <p>For the determination whereof it is to be noted, that diverſity of reaſon hath bred diverſity of opinion.</p>
                  <p>Some men there are that think that the dignity of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58491:45"/>by writ is not deſcendable from the Anceſtor to the heire, unleſſe the heire be likewiſe ſo called by writ to the Parliament, and that then it becommeth an inheritance, and not before.</p>
                  <p>But this objection is repugnant to the nature of a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which (for the moſt part) doth carry the patrimony deſcendable by act in law, preſently upon the death of the Anceſtor unto the heire, or not at all. Wherefore the cuſtome of our countrey, and manifold preſidents doe prove, that this kind of Barony doth deſcend from the Anceſtors to the heire, and there needs not any words of heirs in the writ of ſummons. Onely one preſident there is in a ſpeciall writ, ſometimes directed to Sir <hi>Henry Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> in 27. <hi>H.</hi> 6. wherein he was ſtiled Lord <hi>Veyſey;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are theſe words inſerted, <hi>Volumus tamen vos &amp; haeredes veſtros maſculos de corpore veſtro legitimè procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos excuntes, Barones de Veyſey existere,</hi> which is to bee read in <hi>Co.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 33. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore as it is true, that where the heire of any ſuch Baron by writ is called to the Parliament, that his deſcent of honour is thereby eſtabliſhed and approved by the gracious judgment of our ſacred Soveraigne; ſo it is alſo true that if it ſhall ſtand with his Highneſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that ſuch heire ſhall not be ſummoned at all, (for none can come to ſo high a Councel unleſſe he be called) then that Nobility is much empaired, and in a manner extinguiſhed, in the cenſure of all men; for that it had none other originall but by writ of ſummons, from the which in the judgment of the ſupreme ſoveraign he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond principall point, whether the Barony by writ may deſcend to the heires females, it ſhall not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58491:46"/>be amiſſe likewiſe to view the reaſons of either part, and by conflict of argument the truth may the better be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that maintain the affirmative part do reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: In reaſon the ſexe of the heire female ought no more to bar her of the dignity, than the nonage of the heire male ought to bar him, although during his nonage he be unable to do the ſervice; but as the ſervice of the one is forborne for a time, ſo the ſexe of the other may at all times be ſupplied by the maturity and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of her husband.</p>
                  <p>Offices of honour which do much import the publique weale, being paſſed by inheritance, do deſcend to the heire female, if there be no nearer heire male. As the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the high Conſtableſhip of England, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the daughters of <hi>Humphrey de Bohun</hi> Earle of Hereford and Eſſex, a memoriall whereof is in <hi>Dyer</hi> 285. but more at large in <hi>Keilway</hi> 6. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the office of Lord-Steward deſcended to <hi>Blanch</hi> daughter to <hi>H.</hi> Earle of Lancaſter: the like may be ſaid of the office of Earle Marſhall, which deſcended by an heire female unto the houſe of Norfolk; all which offices are unfit to be exerciſed by a woman, as it is unfit for a woman to be ſummoned to the Parliament as a Baroneſſe by writ. And many noble houſes in England do ſupport the dignity of Baronage unto them deſcended by women.</p>
                  <p>They which ſtand on the negative part of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, do encounter their adverſaries on this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The writ of ſummons to the Parliament, whereby the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron by writ hath his originall, is to call that honourable and worthy perſon ſo ſummoned to be one of the number of that right high and honourable Aſſembly, and to be a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58491:46"/>Judge to ſit, heare, and determine life and member, plea and right of land, if there ſhall come occaſion; likewiſe to give counſell and advice in the moſt weighty affaires of the Realme. But theſe things are convenient for the quality of men, unfitting and altogether unbeſeeming the ſexe of women: <hi>Ergo,</hi> having reſpect unto the finall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſuch writs, ſuch inheritances ſhould only deſcend unto the heire male, and not unto the heire female.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it ſhall be anſwered, that although the heire female to whom ſuch inheritance is deſcended, be unfit in her owne perſon for the accompliſhing of theſe things, yet ſhe may marry with one ſufficiently able, for her, and in her behalf, to execute the ſame: this anſwer will neither ſatisfie nor ſalve the inconveniences. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſuch heire female were at full age at the death of her Anceſtor, unmarried, it doth lie in her own choice who ſhall be her husband; ſo ſhall the pleaſure of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne in the choice of his Councell, in the great cauſes of the Realme, be ſubject to the will of his ſubject in the choice of her husband, which were altogether inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if ſuch husband ſhall be called in the right of his wife, the writ ſhould make ſome mention hereof: for otherwiſe it may well be taken that the husband was choſen in his own perſon, and in behalfe of himſelfe, and not in regard of his wife, or ſuch pretended dignity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended unto him: But there was never ſuch writ of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſeen wherein the wife was mentioned; and if the husband of ſuch wife have been called to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is alwayes by generally writ, not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his wife, he is now made thereby a Baron of himſelf, and in his own right, by that writ.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:58491:47"/>
                  <p>Having thus heard both ſides ſpeak, place doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to interpoſe opinion to compound this controverſie.</p>
                  <p>This queſtion or point is ſomewhat perplexed, by means of difficult preſidents: for firſt, it is obſerved that ſome preſidents do prove that Baronies by writs have deſcended unto heires females, whoſe husbands have beene called to the Parliament, whether in regard of themſelves, or in regard of their wives it matten not. But ſure it is, that the marriage of ſuch Ladies gave them occaſion ſo to be ſummoned; and ſuch husbands and their poſterity have and do lawfully beare the ſame name of dignity, which the Anceſtors of ſuch wife did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightfully beare: For by this controverſie there is no purpoſe to call the right of ſuch noble houſes into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howbeit, ſecondly, this is to be obſerved out of the preſidents, and to be acknowledged of every dutifull ſubject, that the Kings Majeſty is nevertheleſſe at liberty to call to the high Councell of Parliament, whom his Highneſſe ſhall in his Princely wiſdom think moſt meet: which his Majeſties Progenitors have in former ages ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>And therefore whereas <hi>Radulph</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> being a Baron by writ died without iſſue, having two ſiſters and coheirs; <hi>Eliz.</hi> the eldeſt married to Sir <hi>Tho. Nevill</hi> Knight, and <hi>Joan</hi> the younger married Sir <hi>Hunt Bourcher,</hi> he who had married the younger ſiſter was called to the Parliament as L. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and not the ſaid Sir <hi>Tho. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> who had married the elder ſiſter. 3. It is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that if a Baron by writ die without heire male, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his daughter, ſiſter, or other collaterall heire male, that doth or can challenge the lands of the ſaid Baron deceaſed, by any ancient entaile or otherwiſe, the title of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58491:47"/>ſuch heire female hath bin heretofore allowed as by the honourable opinions and relations of the right honourable the late Commiſſioners in the office of Earle Marſhall, ſignified unto the late Queene, upon the Petition of the ſiſter and heire of <hi>Gregory,</hi> late Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> deceaſed, may appeare.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in the ſame Pedegree of the ſaid Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> it is expreſſed, that <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſometimes Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> had iſſue <hi>Thomas</hi> his eldeſt ſon, <hi>Ralph</hi> his ſecond ſonne, and <hi>Humphrey</hi> his third ſonne. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the eldeſt, dyed in the life time of his Father, having Iſſue <hi>Ioan</hi> his daughter and heire, who was marryed unto Sir <hi>Richard Fines</hi> Knight. And after <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> her Grandfather, and Father unto the ſaid Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Humphrey</hi> dyed. After whoſe death, <hi>Henry</hi> 6. by his Letters Parents, bearing date at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 7. <hi>Novem. Anno</hi> 7. <hi>regni,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the ſaid Pedegree, and Marriage, doth by his Letter a Pattents accept, declare, and repute the ſaid <hi>Richard Fines</hi> to be Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and one of the Barons of his Realme. But afterward in the time of <hi>Edw:</hi> 4. the ſaid <hi>Humphrey Dacres</hi> after the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindor of the ſaid <hi>Ralph,</hi> and himſelfe by an Act of Parliament, which was in 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and after the death of the ſaid <hi>Ralph,</hi> and after the reverſall of the ſame Act, by another Act, 12. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. the ſaid <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> made challenge unto the ſaid Barony, and to divers Lands of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> his Father; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both parties after their title had been conſidered in Parliament, ſubmitted themſelves unto the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and entred into Bond each to other for the performance thereof. Wherupon the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58491:48"/>ſaid King in his award under his Privie ſeale, bearing date at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 8. <hi>April. Anno regni</hi> 13. did award, that the ſaid <hi>Rich: Fines</hi> in the right of <hi>Ioan</hi> his wife, and the Heires of his body lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſhould be reputed, had, named and called, Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Richard Fines,</hi> and the Heires of his body by the ſaid <hi>Ioane</hi> begotten, ſhould keepe, have, and uſe the ſame ſtate and place in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parliament, as the ſaid <hi>Thomas Dacres</hi> Knight, late Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> had uſed, &amp; kept, &amp;c. that the heires of the body of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Dacres</hi> Knight, late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> lawfully begotten, ſhould have and hold to them &amp; their Heires, the Mannor of <hi>Holbech,</hi> And furthermore the ſaid King did award on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, that the ſaid <hi>Humphrey Dacres</hi> Knight, and the Heires males of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> ſhould be reputed, had, named, and called the L. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres</hi> of <hi>Gilleſland:</hi> And that he and the heires males of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> then late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> ſhould have uſe, and keepe the place in Parliament next adjoyning beneath the ſaid place, which the ſaid <hi>Rich: Fines</hi> Knight, Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> then had and occupied, and that the heires of the body of the ſaid <hi>Ioan</hi> his wife ſhould have and occupie. And that the Heires males of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Dacres,</hi> late L. <hi>Dacres</hi> ſhould have to them &amp; to the heires males of their bodies begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Mannor of <hi>Jothington,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo note that the name of the ancient Barony, namely <hi>Gileſtand,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unto the Heire male, unto whom the land was entailed. Moreover, this is ſpecially obſerved, if any Baron by writ doe dy, having none other iſſue then Female, and that by ſome ſpeciall entail or other
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58491:48"/>aſſurance there be an heire male which doth enioy all, or a great part of the lands, poſſeſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of ſuch Barons deceaſed, the Kings of this Realme have uſed to call to the Parliament by writ as Baron ſuch heire male, omitting the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or iſſue male of ſuch heire female, and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeareth by a notable controverſie in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. betweene Sir <hi>Robert Willoughby</hi> Lord <hi>Brooke,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> for the Barony of <hi>Latimer</hi> which in effect was: The ſaid Lord <hi>Brooke</hi> did challenge the Barony of <hi>Latimer,</hi> as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and Heire to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his great grandmother who was ſiſter and heire to <hi>Iohn Nevill,</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> who died without iſſue and hereupon exhibited a Petition to <hi>Henry</hi> 7. in Parliament, whereto <hi>Richard</hi> then Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> was called to anſwer, becauſe he then enioyed the ſaid title and dignity; The ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> by his anſwer did ſhew that it was true that after the death of the ſaid <hi>Iohn Nevill,</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without iſſue, the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the ſiſter and next heire, and married unto Sir <hi>Thomas Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longhby</hi> Knight, ſecond ſon of the Lord <hi>VVillough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> 6. for that the ſaid <hi>Iohn Nevill</hi> was dead without iſſue, and that the next heire was fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, did therefore call to the Parliament, <hi>George Nevill</hi> Knight ſecond ſon of <hi>Ralph</hi> Earle of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland</hi> to be Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> as Cozen and next heire male of the ſaid <hi>Iohn Nevil</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> which <hi>George</hi> was grandfather of the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> namely Father of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi> Father of the ſaid <hi>Richard,</hi> In debate of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58491:49"/>which cauſe, the queſtion now in hand whether a Barony by writ may diſcend unto the heirea ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, was adviſedly conſidered of by the ſaid King and his Nobility in Parliament, and in the end ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged with the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer:</hi> which Preſident doth afford us two Iudgements in this point, one in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. when the writ was directed to the ſaid Sir <hi>George Nevill,</hi> whereby he was ſummoned as Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> to the Parliament, and as heire Male, and not the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby</hi> Knight, husband of the ſaid <hi>Eliza.</hi> heire male: And the ſecond judgement was given in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. whereby the Barony was adiudged vnto the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> comming of the ſpeciall heire male, againſt the ſaid Lord <hi>Brooke</hi> deſcended of the generall heire male.</p>
                  <p>But here the Preſident before remembred of the Barony of <hi>Dacres</hi> may be objected to incounter this confuſion: For there was an heire female martied unto Sir <hi>Richard Fines</hi> who by the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was Baron of <hi>Dacres</hi> in the right of his wife, and there was alſo <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Humfrey</hi> the heires males, before whom the heire female was preferred by the cenſure of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>This objection is eaſily anſwered. For although <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. through the Princely favour which hee bare unto Sir <hi>Richard Fines</hi> had declared him to bee Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> in the right of his wife, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did <hi>Ralph Dacres</hi> being heire male unto the then Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> deceaſed, beare alſo the name of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Dacres,</hi> and by that name was attainted in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58491:49"/>Wherefore the reaſon why the heire male could not bee regarded was the ſaid attainder of the ſaid <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Humfrey</hi> his brother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Humphrey</hi> 12. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. laboured to have the ſaid attainder reverſed, he ſubmitted himſelfe vnto the Arbitrament of the King, who to ſatisfie both Competitors, becauſe both had well deſerved of him, after he had admitted them to his favour he allowed the one to be Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> the other to be Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of <hi>Gilleſland;</hi> &amp; thus much concerning the ſecond point, whether a Barony by writ may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto the heire female or not.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the third point, admitting ſuch diſcent to bee to the heire female, when there is no heire male at all that may claime the ſame, for then doth this queſtion take place, whether the husband of ſuch heire female ſhall enioy the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the right of his wife or no; wherein wee are to reſt upon a reſolution had and given in this ſpeciall queſtion which was in this manner.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. when Mr. <hi>Winbie</hi> tooke upon him the ſtile of Lord <hi>Talboys</hi> in the right of his wife, having none iſſue by her, the ſaid King aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted both by Civill and Temporall Lawyers gave ſentence, that no husband of Baroneſſe in her right ſhould uſe the ſtile and dignitie untill he had by her a Child, whereby he ſhould become Tenant by the courteſie unto her inheritance.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall reaſons that occaſioned this ſentence were two: Firſt it ſhould be inconvenient for her husband this day to bee a Baron and Peere of the Realme, and to morrow by the death of his wife
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58491:50"/>ſo become none, and that without the death of the partie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if he had iſſue by his wife and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>ALthough by the Civill Law, there bee no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of title, under Knights, but all the reſt wont under the name of people, yet with us, there are in the ranke who have names of preheminence, whereby they are in degree above the reſt; as Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers and Gentlemen, all which give enſignes or coates of armes, and thereby are diſtingniſhed from the meaner ſort of people, in which reſpect <hi>(Bartol.

               <p>But in theſe dayes he is a Gentleman, who is ſo commonly taken, and reputed, Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> 96. And whoſoever ſtudieth in the Vniverſities, who profeſſeth the liberall ſciences, and to be ſhort, who can live idly, and without manuall labour, and will beare the Port, charge, and countenance of a Gentleman, he ſhall bee called Maſter: For that is the title that men give to Eſquires, and other Gentlemen: For true it is with us, as one ſaid; <hi>Tanti eris aliis quanti tibi ſueris:</hi> and if need be, a King of Heralds ſhall give him for money
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58491:94"/>armes newly made, and invented with the Creaſt and all: the title whereof ſhall pretend to have hin found by the ſaid Herauld, in the peruſing and viewing of old Regiſters, where his anceſtors in time paſt had beene recorded to beare the ſame: or if he will doe it more truly, and of better faith, hee will write, that for the merits of, and certaine qualities that he doth ſee in him, and for ſundry noble acts which he hath performed, hee by the authority which he hath, as King of Heralds in his Province, and of armes, giveth unto him and his heires, theſe and theſe heroicall bearings in arms, <hi>vide Smith de Republic.
